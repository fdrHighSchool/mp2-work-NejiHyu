# Letter Grade
#### Respond to the following:

1. Write a plan for the following extension:
  * Attach a "+" on their grade if the grade ends in a 7, 8 or 9 (eg: 78 -> C+, 89 -> B+)
  * Attach a "-" on their grade if the grade ends in a 0, 1 or 2 (eg: 92 -> A-, 61 -> D-)

    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**
I will need:
for loop
if statements
%10
arrays
<=
>=
>
<

2. Discuss how you would make sure 100 is not misrepresented as an A-.
  * I would make sure that 100 is not misrepresented as an A- by not putting 100 in an if statement.


3. Discuss how you would make sure grades that are an F are not mislabeled as F- or F+ (eg: 49 -> F+ and 52 -> F-)
  * I would make sure grades that are an F are not mislabeled as F- or F+ by using >=, <=, < or >
