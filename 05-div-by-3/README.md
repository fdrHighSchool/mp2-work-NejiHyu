# Div By 3
#### Respond to the following:

1. A number is considered *prime* if its only factors are 1 and itself. For example, 7 is prime (1 and 7 are the only factors) and 9 is not (1, 3 and 9 are factors).  
Outline an algorithm to determine whether or not a number is prime.  
Think of the following method header:
`public static boolean isPrime(int num)`

  * I will make if statements to determined if it's div by 3 then it's true so I keep it. But if it's not then it's technically false and probably a prime.
